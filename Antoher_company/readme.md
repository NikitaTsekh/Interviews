This is interview  for junior position in another company. 


No test tasks, 2 parts:
Theory + Code interview


Theory:
1)What did you do on last job?
2)What metrics do you know for classification?
Explain them and right formulas for precision, recall.
3)What metrics do you know for regression?
4)SQL task
What joins do you know?
a)simple task for group by etc (dont remember)

b) more complex task

We have 2 tables, t1 and t2 (below) What would be the result of inner join (full code below)?
t1

1

1

2

2

3



t2

1

1

2

3

3

select t1.id from t1

INNER join t2 on t1.id=t2.id

5)Apache airflow task
Given scheme of 6 dags, 3 parallel 5 consesquentially, code it using Dummy Operators

6)ML algorythms:
-WHat is the differnece between loss function and metric?
-How does Gradient Boosting algo works? Why it is cold Gradient Boosting and not Gradient?
-What are importatn paraemtres for Gradient Boosting tuning?
-How does linear regression works? 
-How does random forest works?
-What is bias and variance?

----------------------------



Part 2 (Code interview)
-------------------------
1.What data strcutures do you know?
Which of them are mutable which are immutable?

2.What is generator what is iterator and whats the difference?

Basicallly it was all LeetCode easy tasks:

1.<see python file>

2.Given an selection sortarray of integers, code sorting fucntion (any algorythm is fine) and tell space and time complexity.
I gave selection sort algorythm.

3.<see python file>
